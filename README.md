# Hi, I'm Onish | Rustacean & Python Developer

I am an 11-year-old developer based in Amritsar, Punjab. While most people my age are playing games, I am building them from the hardware up. I specialize in **Low-Level Rust**, **RISC-V Architecture**, and **Operating System Development** (On break from this).

### What I’m Working On:
* **Vibe Code Suite:** An ast-based python script with a Textual TUI that automatically gets the focus function, its dependencies and sends it to Gemini-2.5-Flash via the v1beta endpoint.

### My Thinking:
* **License:** I believe in the **GNU GPL v3**. If I build it, the world should own it, and if you improve it, you should share it.

### The Hardware Mission:
I am currently coding in Termux (Lenovo YT-X705X) because I am saving up for my first real PC. (Need about ₹60,000.)

## Special Thanks
* **The Rust Community:** For making Rust powerful enough to build the future.
* **The Python Community:** For making the python `std` library powerful enough to do In-place replacements.
* **You:** For reading this far.

### Thank You!
