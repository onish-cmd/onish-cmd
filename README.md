# ⚡ Hi, I'm Onish | Systems Architect & Rustacean

I am an 11-year-old developer based in Amritsar, Punjab. While most people my age are playing games, I am building them from the hardware up. I specialize in **Low-Level Rust**, **RISC-V Architecture**, and **Operating System Development**.

### 🛠 What I’m Working On:
* **Onish-OS:** A custom Linux distribution built from scratch (LFS) for the Milk-V Duo.
* **onish_init:** A memory-safe `init` process (PID 1) written in `#![no_std]` Rust.
* **Hardware Abstraction:** Writing raw UART drivers to communicate directly with silicon.

### 📜 My Philosophy:
* **License:** I believe in the **GNU GPL v3**. If I build it, the world should own it, and if you improve it, you should share it.
* **Logic:** "If you want it done right, you should just do it yourself." — I don't just use OSs; I build them.

### 🚀 The Hardware Mission:
I am currently coding in the cloud (Project IDX) because I am saving up for my first **Milk-V Duo 256M (RISC-V)** board. My goal is to move my `no_std` Rust kernel from the simulator to real bare-metal hardware.

**[ 🛰️ Seeking Bounties & Sponsorships ]**
I am looking for small Rust bugs to squash or unit tests to write in exchange for hardware funding (₹1,301 / ~$16 USD).

## 🤝 Special Thanks
* **The Rust Community:** For making `no_std` powerful enough to build the future.
* **Google:** For making Firebase Studio (Project IDX) which has helped me code on mobile.
* **Gemini:** My AI thought partner for technical brainstorming and motivation.
* **You:** For reading this far.

### Thank You!
